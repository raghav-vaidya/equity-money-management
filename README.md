# Equity Money Management

An index fund is like a bundle that includes a variety of stocks or bonds. It aims to mimic the performance of a specific market index, such as the NASDAQ 100. By investing in an index fund, you essentially own a small piece of numerous companies, providing a diversified and simplified approach to investing. Few of the components of NASDAQ 100 are given below.

In the world of managing money in stocks, there are two main strategies: "active" and "passive." The common passive strategy is called "indexing," where the idea is to create a portfolio that follows the ups and downs of the overall market or a specific market index. This portfolio is known as an index fund.

If you wanted to make an index fund that copies a whole bunch of stocks in a market index, you might think of just buying all of them with the same proportions they have in that index. However, that's not practical and can be costly due to various reasons like having too many small positions and the expenses of keeping everything in balance. So, instead of buying all the stocks (let's call them 'n'), people often choose a smaller number of stocks (let's call them 'm'), which is much more manageable and still does a good job of representing the larger market.

To accomplish this, we have used a combination of Linear and Integer Programming modeling to come up with a fund that closely follows the NASDAQ 100 index. We will discuss the approach in detail in the following sections.
